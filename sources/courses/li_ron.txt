Master Cursor.ai: Unleash the Builder Within the Researcher

Ron Li is a data science entrepreneur and educator, with experience in both industry and academia. He graduated from USC with two master's degrees in physics and electrical engineering. Ron will be assisted by Yixiang Yao (https://www.isi.edu/directory/yixiangy/), a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Southern California. Yixiang's research focuses on implementing privacy-enhancing technologies in general AI applications, including privacy-preserving entity resolution and language model privacy enhancement. 

Generative AI has redefined the boundaries of what researchers can build and achieve, turning the seemingly impossible into reality. As statisticians and mathematicians, we pride ourselves on rigorous reasoning and analytical thinking, but true innovation requires embracing the spirit of creation. Cursor.ai empowers researchers to transcend traditional limitations, enabling them to design, experiment, and innovate in ways never before imagined. In this course, we will explore two key methodological aspects of interacting with AI: how to explain complex concepts effectively and how to master efficient prompt engineering. These skills are crucial for unlocking the full potential of tools like Cursor.ai, ensuring that the AI becomes not just a tool, but a collaborator in your creative journey. Designed for master’s and beginning PhD students in statistics and mathematics, this course aims to ignite the creator’s spirit within. Through hands-on exploration of Cursor.ai’s capabilities, students will learn how to leverage AI to tackle complex problems, automate labor-intensive processes, and pioneer new approaches in research. By the end of the course, participants will emerge not just as users of technology, but as visionary creators in the era of AI-driven discovery.
