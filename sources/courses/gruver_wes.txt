This session is an introduction to contextual generative AI solutions using the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method. First, you’ll be introduced to RAG architecture and the significance of contextual information using Mosaic AI Playground. Next, we’ll show you how to prepare data for generative AI solutions and connect this process with building a RAG architecture. Finally, you’ll explore concepts related to context embedding, vectors, vector databases, and the utilization of Mosaic AI Vector Search. The session is aimed at data scientists, machine learning engineers, and other data practitioners who want to build generative AI applications using the latest and most popular frameworks and Databricks capabilities.
