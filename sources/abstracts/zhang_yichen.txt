Online Inference for Robust Policy Evaluation in Reinforcement Learning 

Reinforcement learning has gained prominence in modern statistics, with policy evaluation being a key component. Unlike traditional machine learning literature on this topic, our work places emphasis on statistical inference for the parameter estimates computed using reinforcement learning algorithms. While most existing analyses assume random rewards to follow standard distributions, limiting their applicability, we embrace the concept of robust statistics in reinforcement learning by simultaneously addressing issues of outlier contamination and heavy-tailed rewards within a unified framework. In this paper, we develop an online robust policy evaluation procedure, and establish the limiting distribution of our estimator, based on its Bahadur representation. Furthermore, we develop a fully-online procedure to efficiently conduct statistical inference based on the asymptotic distribution. This paper bridges the gap between robust statistics and statistical inference in reinforcement learning, offering a more versatile and reliable approach to policy evaluation.
