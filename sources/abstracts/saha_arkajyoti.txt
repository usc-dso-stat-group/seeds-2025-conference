Random Forests for Geospatial Data

Due to recent advancements in geographical information systems, remote sensing technology, and affordable sensors, we are now faced with datasets that require us to consider spatial dependencies. These geospatial data are often analyzed using the linear mixed model framework, which includes a linear fixed covariate effect and a Gaussian Process (GP)-distributed spatial random effect. However, the assumption that covariate effects are linear is quite limiting. Non-linear modeling of spatial data is gaining popularity, and contemporary extensions of Random Forests (RF) for spatial data diverge from the mixed model setup, giving up inference on the fixed effects and other benefits of utilizing GP. By explicitly modeling the spatial random effects with a GP, we offer a unique and well-principled extension of RF for estimating nonlinear covariate effects in spatial mixed models. Our method extends RF in the same way generalized least square extends ordinary least squares to accommodate for dependence in linear models. For both estimation and prediction with spatial data, our method significantly outperforms classical RF in an extensive simulation study.
