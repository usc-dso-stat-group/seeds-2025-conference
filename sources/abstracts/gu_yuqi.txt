Minimax-Optimal Covariance Projected Spectral Clustering for High-Dimensional Anisotropic Mixtures 

In mixture models, nonspherical or anisotropic noise within each cluster is widely present in real-world data. We consider both the minimax rate and estimation procedure for clustering under high-dimensional anisotropic mixture models. In high-dimensional settings, we first establish the information-theoretic limits for clustering under Gaussian mixtures. The minimax lower bound unveils an intriguing informational dimension-reduction phenomenon. Motivated by the lower bound, we propose a novel computationally efficient clustering method, the Covariance Projected Spectral Clustering. This method is designed to discern variations in the covariance matrices across different clusters in the lens of a low-dimensional subspace. Its key step is to project the high-dimensional data onto the space spanned by the cluster centers and then use the covariance adjustment in this space to enhance clustering. Theoretically, we establish tight algorithmic upper bounds for our method, both for Gaussian noise with arbitrary dependence and general noise with local dependence. Our theory indicates the minimax-optimality of our method in the Gaussian case and highlights its adaptivity to a broad spectrum of dependent noise. Extensive simulation studies under various noise structures and a high-dimensional genetics dataset analysis demonstrate our method's superior performance.
