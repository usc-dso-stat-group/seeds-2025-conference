Navigate the Crossroad of Statistics, ML/AI and Domain Science

The data science ecosystem encompasses data fairness, scalable statistical and ML/AI methods and tools, interpretable data analysis, and trustworthy decision-making. Rapid advancements in AI have revolutionized data utilization and enabled machines to learn from data more effectively. Statistics, as the science of learning from data while accounting for uncertainty, plays a pivotal role in addressing complex real-world problems and facilitating trustworthy decision-making. In this talk, I will discuss the challenges and opportunities as we navigate the crossroad of statistics and AI, including how to build an end-to-end scalable data science ecosystem, leverage AI/ML-prediction to empower statistical analysis of biobank data,  transfer inference for genetic association analysis,  build the whole genome variant functional annotation database and portal FAVOR and FAVOR-GPT,  and incorporate multi-faceted variant functional annotation to boost power of whole genome sequencing end-to-end analysis. This talk aims to ignite proactive and thought-provoking discussions, foster cross-disciplinary collaboration, and cultivate open-minded approaches to advance scientific discovery.
